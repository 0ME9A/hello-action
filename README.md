## Introduction

GitHub Actions allow you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your GitHub repository. This repository contains examples and best practices for setting up GitHub Actions to automate CI/CD pipelines.

## Features

- **Automated Testing:** Automatically run tests with each push or pull request.
- **Build and Deploy:** Automatically build and deploy your application to your preferred environment.
- **Scheduled Jobs:** Run jobs on a scheduled basis.
- **Matrix Builds:** Test across multiple versions and configurations.

## Getting Started

To get started with GitHub Actions, you need a GitHub repository. If you haven't already, create a repository and then clone it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0me9a/hello-actions.git
cd github-actions-demo
```

Ensure you have a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository. This is where you'll define your workflows.

## Usage

### Example Workflow

Below is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow file located at `.github/workflows/main.yml`. This workflow runs tests on multiple versions of Node.js.

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14, 16, 18]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test
```

### Workflow Explanation

- **name:** Names the workflow "Node.js CI".
- **on:** Specifies the events that trigger the workflow. This example triggers on push or pull request to the `main` branch.
- **jobs:** Defines the jobs to be run. Each job runs in a fresh virtual environment.
- **runs-on:** Specifies the operating system for the virtual environment.
- **strategy:** Defines a matrix of different Node.js versions to test against.
- **steps:** Lists the steps to be executed in the job. This includes checking out the repository, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies, and running tests.

## Workflows

### Build and Deploy

Here's an example of a workflow that builds and deploys a Node.js application:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16'
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm run build
    - name: Deploy
      run: npm run deploy
      env:
        DEPLOYMENT_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOYMENT_KEY }}
```
